# Projects on Computational Physics

List of projects contained in this repository: 

### QuanSim 
Project based on computing different magnitudes such as the density profile, the pair correlation or the Yrast line for a quantum system formed by bosons for diferent states. The code reproduces the exact diagonalization of the matrices and camputes each of this paramenters. 

This project was part of the Quantum Simulation course in my master degree in Physics. 

Coded in Python. [Code Paper]

### PhaseTrans
Project based on using the MonteCarlo method to reproduce the beahviour of a 2D Ising model to compute the main magnitudes to characterize the phase transition of the system. 

This project was part of the Collective Phenomena and Phase Transition course in my bachelor degree in Physics. 

Coded in Fortran [Code Paper]
